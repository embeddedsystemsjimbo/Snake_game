# Snake_game

This Snake game was created using Python and the "Turtle Graphics" library to demonstrate and practice OOP programming concepts.

This version of the Snake game is based of the mobile version of Snake introduced by Nokia on mobile phones in the late 90s. However, the "Snake game" genre dates back to the 70s, when the game concept was first introduced on the arcade game "Blockade". The up movement is the "w" key, left movement is  the "a" key, right movement is the "d" key and down movement is the "s" key. 

To run game, execute " Python3 snake_game.py" from terminal.
